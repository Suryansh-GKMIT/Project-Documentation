Introduction SkillCheck is an enclosed-access online testing system for internal assessments. Admins manage users, Test Creators design tests and assign them to specific users, and Test Takers log in to complete tests within a predefined duration. The MVP includes roles, test creation, question management, user assignment, timed test attempts, and result viewing. Proctoring and monitoring features are excluded from this version. 2. System Overview Frontend: React Backend: Node.js + Express Database: PostgreSQL Authentication: JWT-based authentication for Admin and Test Creators; password-based login for Test Takers Deployment: Internal network or private cloud environment Access Model: No public sign-up; all users managed by Admin 3. Roles and Permissions 3.1 Admin Create users Edit or deactivate users Grant or revoke Test Creator permissions View all tests and results 3.2 Test Creator Create, edit, and delete tests Add and manage test questions Assign users to take tests Publish tests to Active state View results of their tests 3.3 Test Taker Log in securely View only assigned tests Attempt tests once (unless reset) Submit responses before time expires 4. Functional Requirements 4.1 Authentication and Authorization Admin and Test Creators log in using email and password. Test Takers also log in to access assigned tests. System issues JWT to authenticated Admins and Creators. Role-based access ensures only authorized users can create/edit tests. Acceptance Criteria: Unauthorized users cannot access test creation environment. 4.2 User Management (Admin) Add new users with role = Test Creator or Test Taker. Modify existing user details. Activate or deactivate users. Grant or revoke Test Creator privileges. Acceptance Criteria: Users update immediately; inactive users cannot log in. 4.3 Test Management (Creator) Create new tests with title, description, and duration. Save tests as Draft. Publish tests when ready. Only tests in Draft can be edited freely. Tests without attempts may be deleted. Acceptance Criteria: A test cannot be published without at least one question. 4.4 Question Management Only MCQ questions supported in MVP. Each question must have text, 2\u20134 options, and a correct answer. Questions can be updated or removed while the test is in Draft. Acceptance Criteria: All questions linked to correct test ID and stored with valid structure. 4.5 Assigning Users to Tests Creator selects users from the registered user list. Users assigned to the test are stored in a linking table. Only assigned users can attempt the test. Acceptance Criteria: Assigned test becomes visible in Test Taker dashboard immediately after activation. 4.6 Test Attempt Behavior (Taker) Test Taker logs in and sees a list of assigned tests. Timer starts when user clicks \u201cStart Test.\u201d System auto-saves responses as user navigates. Test auto-submits when timer expires. One attempt allowed unless reset manually. Acceptance Criteria: Timer must continue accurately on browser refresh. 4.7 Scoring and Results System scores MCQs based on correct answers. Creator and Admin can view results. Results must show Taker details, timestamps, responses, and score. Creator/Admin can export data in CSV. Acceptance Criteria: Scoring algorithm is accurate and consistent. 5. Non-Functional Requirements Security: Password hashing, JWT, HTTPS, and access control. Performance: Support for multiple simultaneous Test Takers. Reliability: Auto-save to prevent data loss. Usability: Simple dashboards for each role. Data integrity: Responses and scores stored consistently. Extensibility: Future proctoring features must integrate without major redesign. 6. Data Model Overview Users id name email password_hash role (admin, creator, taker) is_active Tests id title description duration_minutes status (draft, active, closed) created_by Questions id test_id question_text options (JSON array) correct_option_id Test Assignments id test_id user_id Attempts id test_id user_id started_at ended_at responses (JSON) score 7. Acceptance Criteria Summary Admin can create and manage users. Test Creator can create tests and assign users. Test Taker sees only assigned tests. Timer works reliably. Auto-submit works correctly. Scoring is accurate. Results are exportable. 8. Future Scope Window/tab-switch monitoring Camera and microphone enforcement AI-based cheating detection Proctoring dashboard Mobile application Randomized question sets per user","title":"Functional Specification"},{"location":"requirements/functional-document/#functional-specification-document","text":"Project: SkillCheck \u2013 Enclosed Access Online Test Platform (MVP)","title":"Functional Specification Document"},{"location":"requirements/functional-document/#1-introduction","text":"SkillCheck is an enclosed-access online testing system for internal assessments.
